title: "eigenface facial recognition"
github_url: "https://github.com/johnny-crawford/EigenFace"
tags: lab
lessons:
  - "i had done a few projects here and there but this was my first big undertaking, i decided to do facial recognition because it just sounds really cool"
  - "the eigenface route came from one of my uni modules (linear algebra) but i ended up chucking myself in the deep end and confusing myself even more haha"
  - "principal component analysis can be used to turn face images into compact eigenfaces that still keep the important info."
  - "even a traditional method like eigenfaces can get solid results (around 89% on a standard face dataset)."
  - "visualizing the mean face and eigenfaces makes it way easier to understand what the model is learning."
  - "a simple nearest neighbor classifier in eigenface space is enough to do basic face recognition."
