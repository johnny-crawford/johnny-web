        <ul class="lesson-list">
          
            <li>i had done a few projects here and there but this was my first big undertaking, i decided to do facial recognition because it just sounds really cool</li>
          
            <li>the eigenface route came from one of my uni modules (linear algebra) but i ended up chucking myself in the deep end and confusing myself even more haha</li>
          
            <li>principal component analysis can be used to turn face images into compact eigenfaces that still keep the important info.</li>
          
            <li>even a traditional method like eigenfaces can get solid results (around 89% on a standard face dataset).</li>
          
            <li>visualizing the mean face and eigenfaces makes it way easier to understand what the model is learning.</li>
          
            <li>a simple nearest neighbor classifier in eigenface space is enough to do basic face recognition.</li>

        <a href="/lab/project-two/" class="project-title">predicting SPY returns with a hybrid LR + LSTM Model</a>
        <ul class="lesson-list">
          
            <li>it’s a hybrid model that tries to predict next day returns for the SPY ETF using linear regression plus an LSTM to capture patterns the linear model misses</li>
          
            <li>my aim going into this was to simply complete the project, a huge struggle of mine</li>
          
            <li>they start with a baseline linear regression on engineered features like momentum and volatility</li>
          
            <li>then they train an LSTM on the regression residuals to see if it can add predictive power</li>
          
            <li>the hybrid didn’t beat the baseline in directional accuracy, but it was a super fun and challenging project</li>
          
            <li>working through the entire pipeline was hard at my level, but i found the data cleaning SO infuriating; definitely a learning experience</li>
