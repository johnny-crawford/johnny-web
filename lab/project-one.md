github_url: "https://github.com/johnny-crawford/EigenFace"
tags: lab
lessons:
  - "PCA can be used to turn face images into compact eigenfaces that still keep the important info."
  - "Even an old-school method like Eigenfaces can get solid results (around 89% on a standard face dataset)."
  - "Visualizing the mean face and eigenfaces makes it way easier to understand what the model is learning."
  - "A simple nearest-neighbor classifier in eigenface space is enough to do basic face recognition."
